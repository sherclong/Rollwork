## Inspiration
After walking around the city with a friend who has to use stroller for her newborn baby, we realized how inaccessible and inconvenient some walking areas could be. Sometimes there aren't sidewalks where frequent walkable places are, or there aren't ramps to some places or the new ramps lead to a building with set of stairs. We take for granted that the current map apps we are used to are good at showing routes and direction for the able community, but not so much for the people who walk or use wheelchairs.   

## What it does
RollWork is a mobile app prototype that is meant to show users walkable and unwalkable areas. This could mean constructions, areas where uses report lack of ramps or accessibility or unsafe terrain. The app also features a street suggestion box where users can submit a suggestion on what could be improved or added. This could be suggesting a ramp or sidewalk to be added in certain places. Other users will then be able to view those spots on a map and upvote suggestions they agree needs attention. 

However, this app doesn't just help the disabled community but also mothers who use strollers, the elderly who would need sidewalks instead of walking on uneven undeveloped areas, the blind who need sidewalk bumps to indicate when they're at an intersection or even abled people who want to want to voice concerns about community safety like needing extra street lamps for a dimly lit area.

This app is about building awareness and community. With enough attention, people like lobbyist can use this to back up and petition for change. This app would be akin to Change.org and give users a platform to voice their opinion about city accessibility and safety. 

## How I built it

## Challenges I ran into
We attempted to make a semi functional IOS app at first, but half way through we realized that we are not as familiar with Swift as we thought and might not be able to deliver a product that is close to our expectation. We decided to switch to Unity and aim for a prototype that showcases the main features of this mobile app idea.
